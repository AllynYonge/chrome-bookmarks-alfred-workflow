# Chrome Bookmarks

>I'm currently working on new version of this workflow, it has already been implemented by using ruby, but currently ruby 1.9.x / 2.x doesn't fully support unicode forms and it is require some gems to do it and it sounds not good for me. That is why I decided to re-implement it by using python and I hope it will be available within a week... :)

This workflow helps you search your bookmarks in Google Chrome by using keyword ```chrome```:
